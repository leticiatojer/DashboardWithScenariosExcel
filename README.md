# DashboardWithScenariosExcel
Completed in January 2020

This project was part of my Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree. In this project, I had to to analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. While working on it, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. 

 I was provided with a csv file containing a clean subset of a larger dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. For my final submission, I had to create a presentation and spreadsheet to be reviewed.

I liked this project because although I wasn't new to Excel, I could learn smarter ways to set up a dashboard. Having an accounting background, analyzing a company's financial performance was not new to me either. However, thanks to this project, I learned to write a couple of nested functions I hadn't thought of before, like INDEX + MATCH.
